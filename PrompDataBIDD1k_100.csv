Commuting by car is among the least efficient of all our activities—not to mention among the least enjoyable, according to detailed research by the Nobel Prize–winning economist Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues. Though one might think that the economic crisis beginning in 2007 would have reduced traffic (high unemployment means fewer workers traveling to and from work), the opposite has been true. Average commutes have lengthened, and congestion has gotten worse, if anything. The average commute rose in 2008 to 25.5 minutes, “erasing years of decreases to stand at the level of 2000, as people had to leave home earlier in the morning to pick up friends for their ride to work or to catch a bus or subway train,” according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which collects the figures. And those are average figures. Commutes are far longer in the big West Coast cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco and the East Coast cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. In many of these cities, gridlock has become the norm, not just at rush hour but all day, every day.

332;"Read the passage and then respond to the question by choosing the response best supported by the passage.
Properly applied polishing treatment is often responsible for establishing and prolonging the shine on metals, and many experts focus heavily on the steps and equipment required to achieve a well polished metal. Another method for achieving a reflective and shiny finish to metals is buffing. Buffing can be used alongside polishing to enhance the mirror-like quality of metals. Like polishing, buffing can help to remove oxidation from metal, increasing its longevity. Sometimes considered to be less harsh than polishing, buffing can also achieve a brighter finish. Buffing aids such as stationary polishers, die grinders, and specialized automated equipment have been developed to attain even shinier finishes with less effort as manual buffing can take considerable strength and stamina depending on the metal and amount of oxidation.

Based on this passage, which of the following best characterizes the author’s opinion of buffing?
A.) Buffing is a more effective method than polishing for achieving a reflective finish on metals.
B.) Buffing is underutilized because of the physical effort needed, but new equipment has helped to automate the process, making it a more attractive substitution for polishing.
C.) Experts focus heavily on polishing and dismiss the benefits of buffing in regard to finishing metals.
D.) Buffing and polishing metals serve similar and complementary purposes.
E.) None of the above"

315;"cientists are on the cusp of a revolutionary leap in renewable energy, and
the future has never looked brighter. Recent advancements in solar
technology are paving the way for more efficient and affordable green
energy solutions, heralding a new era in global power consumption. Traditional
silicon-based solar panels, although effective, have always faced challenges in
terms of cost and efficiency. But with the latest innovations, harnessing the sun's
energy in novel ways is closer.
The scientific community is buzzing with excitement, especially about a new
material: perovskite. Dr. Linda Feldman, a leading researcher in renewable energy
from Stanford University, recently showcased a perovskite solar cell prototype that
boasts an efficiency rate of over 30%. To put this into perspective, most
commercial solar panels today hover around 15-20% efficiency. ""It's a game-
changer,"" declares Dr. Feldman, ""not only is perovskite more efficient, but it's also
significantly cheaper to produce, making solar energy more accessible to
households globally."" This sentiment is echoed by tech giants like Apple and
Google, who have already expressed interest in integrating these high-performance
solar cells into their future green initiatives.
While the direct environmental impact of these advancements is clear, there is also
a broader societal shift on the horizon. As green technology becomes more
affordable and efficient, a reduction in dependence on fossil fuels is imminent.
This transition has the potential to reshape global economies, reducing energy
costs, creating green jobs, and playing a pivotal role in combating climate change.
As the world grapples with the urgent need for sustainable solutions, breakthroughs
like this bring a ray of hope, illuminating the path to a brighter, greener future.

Man2: Bathing your dogs can indeed be a challenging task, especially if they aren't fond of water. Here are a few tips to make the process more comfortable for your pets:

1. Positive Association: Associate bath time with positive experiences. Provide treats, toys, or praises to make your dogs look forward to their baths.

2. Water Temperature: Ensure the water temperature is just right - not too hot and not too cold. Dogs are sensitive to extreme temperatures.

3. Use a Non-Slip Mat: Place a non-slip mat in the tub to prevent your dogs from slipping and getting frightened.

4. Gentle Spray: Don't spray water directly onto your dog's face. Instead, gently pour or spray water onto their body. 

5. Use Dog-Specific Shampoo: Use a gentle, dog-specific shampoo that won't irritate their skin or eyes.

6. Protect their Ears: Water or soap in the ears can cause discomfort or infection. Use cotton balls to gently block the ear canal during bath time.

7. Rinse Thoroughly: Ensure all the shampoo is rinsed out to prevent skin irritation.

8. Dry Properly: Use a soft towel to dry them off, and make sure they are thoroughly dried, especially in colder weather.

9. Brush Before and After: Brushing your dog before a bath can help loosen any dirt or debris, making the bath more effective. Brushing after a bath can help remove any loose fur and keep their coat looking its best.

10. Keep it Calm: Try to keep the environment calm and quiet during bath time. Too much noise or activity can stress your pet.

Remember, each dog is unique, so it's essential to be patient and adjust your approach based on your dogs' comfort levels and behaviors.

Man1: Are there any particular breeds that I don't have to worry about bathing? I've heard this from friends, but I never researched this particular topic.
